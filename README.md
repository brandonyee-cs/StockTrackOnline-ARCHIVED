## Introduction

**StockTrackOnline is a Work-In-Progress**

StockTrackOnline (STO) is a web application designed for new investors seeking high-quality stock indicators and forecasts at no cost. We leverage various calculations and Machine Learning models to generate reliable predictions. This project is a solo endeavor, and your support would be greatly appreciated to maintain free access to STO.

## Features

- **Easy Access to Information**: STO aims to provide users with a one-stop platform for all investment-related information, excluding news. It offers data that is typically only available through premium services. This can be useful for investors who want to have all the necessary information at their fingertips without having to subscribe to multiple services.

- **Stock Screener**: STO includes a stock screener that allows users to filter stocks based on certain criteria such as market capitalization and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This can be useful for investors who want to narrow down their search to stocks that meet specific requirements.

- **Standard Trading Indicators**: STO calculates various standard trading indicators such as Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio. These indicators can provide a basic view of the market and are a good starting point for investors who are new to stock trading.

- **Advanced Trading Indicators**: STO calculates various advanced trading indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and others. These indicators can provide a comprehensive view of the market and can be useful for more experienced investors who want to make more informed trading decisions.

- **AI-Based Indicators and Projections**: STO employs multiple Machine Learning models to generate reliable projections for various indicators and share prices. This can be useful for investors who want to leverage the power of AI to predict future market trends.

- **Interactive Graphs**: STO provides interactive graphs for various trading indicators. These graphs allow users to visualize the data in a more intuitive way, making it easier to identify trends and patterns. This can be useful for investors who want to analyze the performance of a stock over time.

- **Public Sentiment Analysis**: STO uses the Alpha Vantage API to get the sentiment score for a given stock symbol. This score is based on the analysis of recent news articles and social media posts about the stock. This can be useful for investors who want to understand the public sentiment towards a particular stock.

- **News Retrieval**: STO can retrieve recent news articles about a given stock symbol using the News API. This can be useful for investors who want to stay updated with the latest news about the stocks they are interested in.
