## Introduction

StockTrackOnline (STO) is a web application designed for new investors seeking high-quality stock indicators and forecasts at no cost. We leverage various calculations and Machine Learning models to generate reliable predictions. This project is a solo endeavor, and your support would be greatly appreciated to maintain free access to STO.
