## Introduction

**StockTrackOnline is a Work-In-Progress**

StockTrackOnline (STO) is a web application designed for new investors seeking high-quality stock indicators and forecasts at no cost. We leverage various calculations and Machine Learning models to generate reliable predictions. This project is a solo endeavor, and your support would be greatly appreciated to maintain free access to STO.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Investment Information**: STO is designed to be a comprehensive platform for all investment-related information, excluding news. It offers data that is typically only available through premium services. This includes detailed stock indicators, financial metrics, and forecasts, providing investors with a wealth of information at their fingertips without the need for multiple subscriptions.

- **Stock Screener**: The stock screener feature in STO allows users to filter stocks based on a variety of criteria such as market capitalization, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and more. This feature is designed to help investors narrow down their search to stocks that meet specific requirements, making the investment decision process more efficient.

- **Standard and Advanced Trading Indicators**: STO calculates a wide range of trading indicators, both standard and advanced. Standard indicators such as Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio provide a basic view of the market, while advanced indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and others offer a more comprehensive view. These features cater to both novice and experienced investors, helping them make informed trading decisions.

- **AI-Based Indicators and Projections**: Leveraging the power of Machine Learning, STO generates reliable projections for various indicators and share prices. This feature is designed for investors who want to utilize AI technology to predict future market trends, providing them with a competitive edge in the market.

- **Interactive Graphs**: STO provides interactive graphs for various trading indicators, allowing users to visualize data in an intuitive way. This feature makes it easier for investors to identify trends and patterns, aiding in the analysis of a stock's performance over time.

- **Company Profile**: The CompanyProfile feature provides detailed information about a company, including its financials and key metrics. This can be useful for investors who want to understand the fundamentals of a company before investing.

- **Economic Calendar**: The economicCalendar feature provides information about upcoming economic events that could impact the stock market. This can be useful for investors who want to stay informed about market-moving events.

- **Price Projections**: The LSTM model in the priceprediction feature uses historical stock price data to predict future prices. This can be useful for investors who want to forecast potential price movements.

- **News**: The news feature (currently in development) will provide the latest news related to a specific stock or the stock market in general. This can be useful for investors who want to stay updated on news that could impact their investments.

- **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**: The upcoming sentiment analysis feature will analyze social media posts to gauge public sentiment towards specific stocks. This can be useful for investors who want to understand the market sentiment before making investment decisions.
